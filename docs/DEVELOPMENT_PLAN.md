## Notes for Developers

### How to Use This Plan
1. Before starting work, review current sprint tasks
2. Pick uncompleted tasks from the current phase
3. Update task status when completed
4. Add new tasks as discovered
5. Move completed phases to archive section

### Updating This Document
- Mark completed tasks with [x]
- Add completion dates for phases
- Document any blockers or changes
- Keep backlog updated with new ideas
- Review and update weekly

### Priority Guidelines
- Core functionality first
- User-facing features before optimizations
- Critical bugs before new features
- Security and privacy always high priority
